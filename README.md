<p>In this first screen recording, I created a resource group named "Project RG". A resource group in Microsoft Azure is "container" that can hold all your desired resources within azure. Essentially it can be prepared to a Google Drive.

<p>Next I created a virtual machine. A virtual machine is a digital computer that can be used through remote desktop that has the ability to carry out all normal computer functions. While creating the virtual machine, there are an array of servers you can use and sizes that offer the best compatibilty for your needs.

Once the deployment is complete, you can access all information about the virtual machine you created. In order to link the digital computer, you'll need the public IP address and the username and password you created in the intial creation. Once you enter the IP address and the login credentials, you'll have access to your vitrual machine. </p>

After you complete all your tasks on the virtual machine, be sure to delete the resource group so your microsoft azure credit won't run up. If you delete the whole resource group, everything inside of it will delete as well.
